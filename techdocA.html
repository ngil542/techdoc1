<h1>Machine Learning Techniques for Intrusion Detection</h1>
<h2>by Natalie Gilmore</h2>

<p>
	Intrusion detection utilizes Machine Learning algorithms, Artificial Intelligence algorithms, and metrics, as a basic foundation to examine the dynamic change of data modified on a network or a host computer.  The testing perspective is to take a snapshot of data that has either been sitting on a host computer, hard drive, or in motion on a network, and then a comparison is made between past and future data.  This aids in determining when and where the cyber-attack or malicious attack originated.  From research explored, and focusing on Machine Learning, there are three types of problems that need to be solved with data, that is 1) classification, 2)regression, and 3) clustering.  And from these three types, the following techniques are chosen, which include both supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) learning (Ray., 2019, p. 1).

<h3>Supervised vs. Unsupervised Algorithms</h3>
<p>
	Supervised algorithms are linear whereas unsupervised algorithms are non-linear with data manipulation.  It was found that "supervised algorithms, in general, show better classification accuracy on the data with known attacksâ€¦." (Zamani & Movahedi, 2015, p. 4).  One example of a supervised method, a Machine Learning algorithm, is a Decision Tree algorithm (Ray., 2019, p. 3).  With known results, the Decision Tree algorithm achieved the best results, with a "95% true positive rate, 1% false-positive rate" (Zamani & Movahedi, 2015, p. 4).  While this is a great result, in reality, with unseen cyber-attacks, the "detection rate of supervised methods decreases significantly" (Zamani & Movahedi, 2015, p. 4).  Unsupervised algorithms have a better outcome,  a greater accuracy for both unseen and seen cyber-attack types (Zamani & Movahedi, 2015, p. 4).  Other examples of both supervised and unsupervised algorithms are Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Means Clustering, single linkage clustering, and gamma-algoritm (Zamani & Movahedi, 2015, p. 3).

<h3>Use of Machine Learning with Intrusion Detection</h3>
<p>
	Another area that seems very difficult to comprehend, is the use of Machine Learning with intrusion detection when it comes to large high traffic networks that handle varying amounts of data at any given time.  The advantage with large systems is that Machine Learning is better with detecting spam for instance because the method of 'training the algorithm' is "to train a system with training patterns of all classes" (Zamani & Movahedi, 2015, p. 5).

<h3>Machine Learning and the Future</h3>
<p>
	Machine Learning techniques are important for intrusion detection because they are algorithms and software that will be improved over time and hopefully for high traffic networks.  This area of research is important because every day someone is being hacked especially, in a workplace environment that has had some of its intellectual property vandalized or stolen.  If not right now, it is something happening right now, someone is dealing with a hacker on their router, personal computer, or cell phone.  This is and will be a problem for us, and in our personal lives in the future.  As we become more dependent on these communication systems, in most aspects of our lives, home, in the office, etc. this may eventually lead to public or government regulations.

<h3>Final thoughts on solving Intrusion Detection</h3>
<p>
	And finally, another interesting outcome from this research and the information from the journal literature, is that behind solving intrusion detection, Machine Learning and intrusion detection algorithms are used today's problems and sometimes guided to solve other issues as these algorithms learn in a certain way.  These algorithms are used for prediction, medical diagnosis, search engines, chatbots, data mining, biometrics, and imaging.  The idea of looking at the behavior through the eyes of a Machine that has Learned from not only data resulting in our modeling, but also from real-world testing, is intriguing.
